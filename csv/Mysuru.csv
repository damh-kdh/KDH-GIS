The Mudukutore hill blocks the flow of Cauvery forcing the river to change its course and takes a sudden bend 90. at the point of Malingi town. This results in excessive sand deposition. Gradually Malingi is moving backwards owing to rapid soil erosion The swift waters have disintegrated with the boulders in the river resulting in a whirlpool. The 14 layers of sand on S-E or beward side is 6.80 mts. high. As per traditional belief the 3 curses given by Alamelamma to Raja Odeyar has resulted in the formation of sand dunes at Talkad. Stratigraphic and numismatic evidence conclusively proves that sand began to accumulate during the late Vijayanagar period  i.e  17th C They are cleared once every 12 years for exposing the buried temple for Panchalinga Darshana.
