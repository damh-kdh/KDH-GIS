The heavy sloping walls the simple arch shape of the merlons the fluted domed corner finials and guldastas are all found here. The receding plans of the entrance portal not found in the earliest building in Gulbarga are seen here.The tomb of Allu one of the two tombs outside the enclosure wall is said to be the only tomb in the Deccan built entirely out of brick. A basketwork-motif on the band below the cresting is interesting.The tomb of Mallu is the second one found outside the enclosure wall of the Dargah. The dome cresting at the point of springing on the exterior is lotus-petal-shaped. The remains of the guldastas may also be seen here.The tomb of Jalal Khan: The guldastas on this structure are said to be quite developed; probably more so than they are found on the two tombs of Allu and Mallu.The tomb of Azam Khan: This tomb has a double-storeyed façade. The merlons are in a trefoil shape. The entrance has some interesting stone pillars and bands of stone carving.The tomb of Khayar Khan also has a double-storeyed façade and trefoil-shaped merlons. There are guldastas of a more complicated design and shape. Stucco work is observed on the external walls.The tomb of Dilawar Khan is a tall domed octagonal structure with narrow pointed recessed arches set in rectangular panels on each side. The panels and recessed arches have black stone margins.
