It consists of a garbhagriha, a closed vestibule, and a navaranga.  There are projections on either side of the flight of steps leading up to the navaranga doorway on which perhaps there were figures of elephants originally. The garbhagriha and navaranga are square and are indented. The basement consists of three cornices of which the third from the bottom has dentil mouldings. The outer walls are plain and have a middle cornice ornamented with rhomboid flowers. The eaves are sharp and relieved by kirtimukhas at intervals. The tower is a stepped pyramid consisting of seven tiers of cornice mouldings decorated with dentil designs. Its front has sukanasi with simhalalata decoration enclosing a figure of Jina.
The navaranga doorway is plain. The four central pillars have each two large cubicle mouldings between which appear circular and 16-sided mouldings. On the faces of the base of each pillar are carved relief figures of kalasas. The navaranga ceilings have exquisite padmas resembling jewellery work. Inside the garbhagriha is a bull on a pitha.","MAR 1941, pp. 94-95.

The façade is completely open with four tall wooden pillars and two corner pilasters infusing a majestic appearance to the monument. Within the hall are three rows of pillars.

The temple is just an oblong hall (17x10.5 m) looking northeast. In the centre of the rear part of the hall is a squarish garbhagriha, (4.5x3.5 m) leaving a closed pradakshinapatha all round. In the garbhagriha is a linga on a pitha of noteworthy workmanship, probably of C. 12th century A.D. At the entrance are Saiva dvarapalas flanking the door. These sculptures appear to be of C. 17th century A.D. Beside the dvarapalas are niches in the wall enshrining the images of Ganesa and Parvati to the right and left respectively. These are of recent period.

The garbhagriha looks oblong from outside as in recent years it has been enclosed creating a small room between the garbhagriha wall and the newly extended walls. In the centre of the garbhagriha is the icon of Anjaneya. The only thing archaeologically important about the temple is that the navaranga and garbhagriha doorway and the four-navaranga pillars are all beautiful Hoysala pieces. These appear to have been brought from some old Jaina temple. The navaranga doorway, the finest of all, has five standing figures at the bottom of each jamb. Above them there are two creeper scrolls, one with animals having varied faces and the other with Yaksha musicians and dancers in convolutions. The central panel of the lintel has a beautiful, though mutilated, Jaina image seated in yogasana under mukkode and supported by a male attender on each side. There is a projecting cornice above on the front in the centre of which also is a seated Jaina image. Right above the garbhagriha is a Keladi style superstructure of brick and lime mortar. On the dome at cardinal points are simhamukhas.","MAR 1945, p. 38.","Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, Mysuru",images/Shivamogga/Pdfs/Sri Kote Anjaneyaswamy temple.pdf,images/Shivamogga/Sri Kote Anjaneyaswamy temple.jpg,images/temple_.png

There is a linga in the garbhagriha and a small Nandi in the navarnga. On either side of the sukanasa doorway there are two devakoshtas, with Ganapati in the right and Durga in the left.

The navaranga and garbhagriha doorframes have panchasakahas. 
The superstructure above the garbhagriha is interesting. It follows the Nagara principle of bhadra projections raising straight up to the top, but is in a stepped pyramidal form with reducing dimension of subsequent talas. The sukanasa projection of the superstructure carries the Hoysala emblem of Sala killing the lion.",Epigraphia Carnataka Vo.

The garbhagriha and antarala are constructed upon an adhishthana in the manchabandha pattern. These plastered walls rising from the adhishtana have shallow arched niches with relief sculptures of the Dasavatara including the incarnations of Buddha and Kalki. The arches over these niches are interesting. The mukhamantapa does not have an adhishthana. Its two square pillars surmounted by floral capitals directly support a tiled roof sloping towards the sides. 
The ceiling of the temple is chiefly decorated with Padma mandala. The bhuvanesvari in the mukhamantapa contains horse-mounted figures of Ashtadikpalakas.  The garbhagriha houses a small Sivalinga. Its doorjamb is plain but the lalata relief has a Sivalinga flanked by Ganesa and Devi along with their vehicles, musika and simha. The doorjambs of the antarala have Saiva dvarapalas and Gajalakshmi lalatabimba.

In the two end bays of the navaranga, nearest the sukanasi, are 4 niches, two facing each other and one on either side of the doorway. Commencing from the left these contain, in order, the images of Saptamatrikas, Umamahesvara, Chamundesvari and Vishnu.

The porch has a bench with a stone railing along its sides, the outer surface of which is decorated with small turrets. The walls are plain; the tower is simple and devoid of the kalasa.
Peculiarly, instead of a linga in the garbhagriha, there is an image of fourhanded Somesvara sitting on the bull and holding trisula, damaru and kapala, the other hand being in the abhaya pose.","MAR 1931, pp. 57-58.
