The fort walls are broad on top and its eastern side contains many square bastions.
The organization / makeup of the second fortification is similar to that of the first even here with broad walls on top square bastions and an arched gate way in the east. In the northern corner is a circular bastion. The gateway structure and its surrounding walls seem to be of later period from type of construction and a lot of mortar is used here. Next to the entrance is a platform on which stands a dome roofed arched small hall bay (ankana) in the same vicinity is another small platform with a Hanuman idol. To the north of the gate is Neelammana temple and Eshwara temple and to the south is Basavanna and Gangadhara temples these temples are of recent origin and simple in style.
Opposite to the third fortification are two platforms having two muslim graves. The fortification consists of square bastion to the east gateway in between two bastion. On either side of the entrance is an arched ankana.
The fourth fortification contains square and circular bastions its east facing gateway is ruined.
The fifth and the final fortification has neither door nor doorframe but just has an entrance. On top of this fort wall there are gun ports to the northwest corner is a huge circular bastion.
Inside this fifth fortification area occupies a Rajawade in the south east corner well Sangameshvara temple to the west a circular watch tower to the northeast and huge hazara structure ruined building in the centre.
