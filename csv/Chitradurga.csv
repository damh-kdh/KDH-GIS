It is an elegant structure possessing considerable architectural merit, being perhaps the only basti of its kind in the state. The sukanasi doorway has perforated screens at the sides. The navaranga has four black stone pillars and its central ceiling, about 2 feet deep, has a lotus bud. Similar ceilings are there in the garbhagriha and sukanasi also. The original Jina image seems to have been lost and in its place there is now a small figure of Anantanatha. The outer walls have a row of fine flowers of various patterns all round.",,,,,,,Department of Archaeology Museums and Heritage Mysuru,images/Chitradurga/Pdfs/Jaina Basadi (Parsvanatha basadi).pdf,images/Chitradurga/Jaina Basadi (Parsvanatha basadi).jpg,images/JainTemple.png

4,Rock Cut temple,Ramadurga,Challakere,Chitradurga,,14.40559,76.54236669,,,,,,,,Dravidian,Darkish Rock,"Between the two fort walls on the west where the rock slopes down, there appears to have been a shallow cave, which is now converted into a cave temple.
The face of the rock has been cut by the architects until a vertical wall (about 7.5 x 3.5 m) was made. Next a regular hall has been hewn with eight pilasters and four pillars (about 2.5 m h). The latter are of Dravidian type bearing mango fruit capitals and images carved on the lower mouldings, like Purushamriga, Varahavatara, Narasimha, Kannappa Nayanar and lion seated on rakshasas. The rock roof above is about a meter thick. Its inner side, i.e. the navaranga ceiling, is divided into 9 compartments. These are carved with beautiful padmas of Hoysala  design.
The navaranga mantapa is 9 x 6 m. The garbhagriha doorway is a well-worked piece. The sanctum, the ceiling of which is unfinished, has a black stone linga (about 1 m high) which appears to have been brought from outside. Behind it are three arched niches, the central one having a relief linga engraved under a seven-hooded cobra. The group is inset in a projecting torana on which are chauri-bearers and dvarapalas.

7,Sri Siddeshwara temple,Nirgunda,Hosadurga,Chitradurga,,13.78159166,76.18818836,,,,,13th century A.D,,,Hoysala,"Chloritic schist, brick and mortar",,"This is a triple shrine temple (trikutachala) with a set of garbhagriha and sukanasi each placed to the north, west and south of a common navaranga. A porch is attached to the eastern side of the navaranga. The plan is squarish with a number of indentations.  The external elevation shows seven plain basement cornices. The walls are plain but relieved by square pilasters and have two courses of eaves with bud-like ornamentation. The brick and mortar tower over the garbhagriha is probably a later addition.
The front porch of the temple is reached by a flight of steps on either side of which are the roughly worked elephant balustrades. The porch proper is raised on two sixteen-fluted pillars with octagonal and square base. The navaranga has four lathe-turned and well-polished pillars in the centre and pilasters around. The doorways of the navaranga, the two side-shrines, and the garbhagriha are exquisitely carved. The figures of Venugopala and Channakesava in the side shrines are of good workmanship. The garbhagriha has a well-worked somasutra and linga. The sukanasi has two finely carved jambs with perforated screens of fine scrolls; within each scroll a human figure is carved.
The lintel has a row of figures of Brahma, Ganesa, Tandavesvara, Kumarasvami and Chennakesava. Saiva dvarapalas are seen on the sides. The side-shrines dedicated to Chennakesava and Venugopala have Vaishnava dvarapalas. The domical ceilings of the temple are well carved, with different designs.",,,,"MAR 1947-56, pp. 33-34.

The garbhagriha contains a linga, about 2 m high, and a pedestal of black stone, placed under a shallow lotus bhuvanesvari. The garbhagriha doorway has Saiva dvarapalas on the jambs. The lintel has projections and drops, common to the Chalukyan and Hoysala style. All the ceilings in the temple are similar. The sukanasi has a Nandi of the 14th century type. The sukanasi doorway has a Gajalakshmi lintel supported by jambs with rhomboid floral ornamentation, all in granite. All round the door, except in the bottom portion, is a perforated screen with square holes. A kalasa is carved on the lower portion of each jamb. On the sides, there are niches now containing a Ganesa and a Kesava, evidently brought here from some other temple.

The open navaranga has sixteen pillars and shallow padma ceilings. A stone railing, 75 cm high, runs round the navaranga. A Ganesa and a viragal are kept here. The temple has a plain pyramidal vimana with seven projecting dentil cornices and a square bottomed sikhara without kalasa.
