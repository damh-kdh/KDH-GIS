It is a plain building with a stone tower. The tower is of stepped pyramidal design with seven cornices. On each face of the sikhara is a kirtimukha with a standing Saiva deity. Over the projection on the sukanasi is a well-carved figure of Sala killing the lion. Here the hero's head is shown bent back in an effort to pull the lion’s tongue out and thrust the sword in.
The inner view shows that the temple must have originally consisted of a garbhagriha with a small linga, a vestibule with a shallow lotus ceiling, and a navaranga of nine squares borne on four cylindrical pillars, with extra cells on the north and south. In the north cell are kept images of Ganesha, Virabhadra, Kesava and Nagas.
Perhaps in the late Hoysala or early Vijayanagara period the front hall of soapstone with cubical pillars having octagonal shafts and ornamental necks appear to have been added. The navaranga, thus extended, came to have ten pillars. This hall has a doorway to the east and another to the south.",,,"Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, Mysuru",images/Tumakuru/Pdfs/Sri Balalingesvara Temple (Kallesvara Temple).pdf,images/Tumakuru/Sri Balalingesvara Temple (Kallesvara Temple).jpg,images/temple_.png

The antarala and the garbhagriha are of equal dimensions and contain austere doorjambs. The four pillars of the navaranga, about 2 m high, are plain. These square-octagonal-square pillars support a simple but square bhuvanesvari. The front entrance is short with simple decorations and resembles the early Ganga-Nolamba style. The adhishthana and the bhittis have undergone complete renovation and have lost their original character. The Dravida tower is built of brick and mortar. The sukanasi projection in the front is a notable feature.
In the navaranga are seen images of two-armed Vinayaka and Durga of Ganga times. It also contains images of Saptamatrikas, Bhairava and Naga. The Sivalinga in the garbhagriha betrays ancient features. Around the temple are some ruined Sivalingas. The temple gives the impression of having had a dvikuta-trikuta plan originally. 
To the south-east of this temple stands the Virabhadrasvami temple of the Vijayanagara period. It consists of a garbhagriha, an antarala, a navaranga and a mukhamantapa. It can be entered from the east and north. Its outer walls are plain but the doorjambs are decorated. The temple has a Dravida sikhara. The figure of Virabhadra, 1 m high, kept inside the garbhagriha has a tranquil look.

The temple has some stone and metallic figures of Srivaishnava saints.

It is said to have been built by a chieftain named Nagareddi. [The place is said to have been so named by a local chief, Nagareddi, after his wife Midigesi, who was so called because her hair (kesha) was so long that it touched her heel, (nidi)].  Its dvaramantapa, which has a large Dravidian brick tower and lion-bracket pillars, has a Ganesa in the south cell and Bhairava in the north cell. Its mukhamantapa has a set of fine pillars with ribbed brackets. The garbhagriha appears to be an ordinary late Hoysala structure. ",,"MAR, 1918, p.8; 1938, p. 10-11.

A mukhamantapa in the Dravidian style has been added during the first quarter of the 20th century. The doorways of the sukanasi and navaranga and the pillars there are well executed. The square ceilings, each about 2 feet deep, are 14 in number; 3 in the 3 cells, one each in the sukanasi and porch and 9 in the navaranga; and all have lotus buds surrounded by rows of petals. The one in front of the north cell shows crossbars; and that of the porch, pointed petals. At the sides of the sukanasi entrance are beautifully carved figures of Ganapati and Mahishamardini. The seated idol in the main cell is known as Yoga-Madhava; the north cell has Lakshminarayana and the south Venugopala, all about 1.5 m tall. All the three images are well executed and their prabhavalis are sculptured with ten avataras. 
On the exterior, the plinth, about a metre high and ornamented with five cornices, runs around the temple following its contour. The walls are decorated with indented square shaped bell pilasters and canopies surmounted by towers of varied shape, like the stepped pyramid with a tapering vertical band, the multiple turreted towers, the star-shaped curvilinear tower, etc.",,"MAR 1934, pp. 24-27.

29,Veeragals,Hiregundagal,Tumkur,Tumakuru,13.43315,77.133718,A.D,Ganga,Stone slabs,"There are more than 20 viragals set up in a group. There are large, rough and heavy granite slabs of irregular shape; some of them measure more than 3 m high. 
Many of these viragals have a single panel covering almost the whole surface of the slab; some of them however, contain two or three panels all carved in low relief. The warriors are shown as engaged in fierce combat holding shields in their left hands and uplifted swords in the right. They are all tall and well-built, and their hair done up above the head in a knot. Their dress consists of a simple viragachche. Many have a necklace and often a dagger tucked to the waist. Some of the warriors are armed with bow and arrows. In two or three of them, they are seen fighting from horse or elephant-back. Where there are three panels, the bottom panel depicts the battle scene, the middle panel shows the hero being carried off by a pair of apsaras, and in the top panel the hero is shown seated on a cushion seat in the virasvarga, attended on either side by celestial chamara-bearing, damsels.
The inscriptions are usually found on the top of the single-panelled stones and on the bands in between the two panels or at the sides where there are two or more panels.",,,"Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, Mysuru",images/Tumakuru/Pdfs/Veeragals.pdf,images/Tumakuru/Veeragals.jpg,images/temple_.png
